# BlackJack

Blackjack is an incredibly popular, exciting and easy card game to play. The object is to have a hand with a total value higher than the dealer’s without going over 21.


## Instructions

Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens are worth a value of 10. An Ace has the value of 1 or 11. The remaining cards are counted at face value

You are dealt two cards each whilst the dealer is dealt one face up. If your first 2 cards add up to 21 (an Ace and a card valued 10), that’s Blackjack! If they have any other total, decide whether you wish to ‘draw’ or ‘stay’. You can continue to draw cards until you are happy with your hand.

Once all cards are drawn, whoever has a total closer to 21 than the dealer wins. If player’s hand and dealer’s hand have an equal value, it’s a tie.
